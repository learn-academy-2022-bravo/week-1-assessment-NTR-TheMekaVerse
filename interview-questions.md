# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a language used to communicate plainly with the computer through a command prompt. This language gives the ability to execute commands that would typically be actions completed by a user in a graphical user interface (GUI)(i.e. right click on anything to reveal its corresponding menu). GitHub is a remote system that serves as the database for files passed to it from a local system.

  Researched answer: Git is an open source developer tool that is used to manage projects by tracking changes made, which ultimately supports multiple developers being able to contribute to one project seamlessly. The main difference between git and Github is that git is a locally managed program, whereas Github is an online service that functions for uploading and downloading source code.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Boolean values should return a desired outcome based on if a statement is TRUE or FALSE. Example operators are >, <, ==, ===, !==.

  Researched answer: Booleans only work to answer if a statement is true or false and this can be done using standalone or combinations of '==', '<', or '>'.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the position of an item, whether it be a letter in a string, a number in a list of numbers, etc. Computers always begin the count of an index at 0. Value is any valid data type that is assigned to a variable.

  Researched answer: Index is an integer that alwyas begins at 0, and that indicates the position of specified data in an array. Values are data of varying types that are "given names" by assigning them to variables.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is an instance in which a variable, function, loop, etc., is established and recalled.

  Researched answer: It is a means of easily, repeatedly calling a single piece of code. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: In pair programming there is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the person sharing their screen and doing the actual typing. The navigator is the person providing input, feedback, and functioning as a second set of eyes to prevent errors and/or troubleshoot during the coding process.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique that includes one person actively coding (driver) and one person reviews the code as it is being written (observer).



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Functions that operate on functions. They will either use the enclosed function as an argument or return the function itself.

2. Jest: Jest is a programming framework used to test JS code.

3. Objects: Objects serve as standalone containers that have their own properties and values apart from other code within a file.

4. Method: A method is a property that can be used on objects to invoke specific actions.

5. Classes: Classes act as the blueprint for creating objects.
